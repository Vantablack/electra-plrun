# electra-plrun

Run binaries with TF_PLATFORM=1

Something to do with:

- [Electra - Getting Started - Platformizing a binary](https://github.com/coolstar/electra/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md)
- https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/842q8w/question_ios_111_electra_104_binary/

## Changes

Made `plrun` into a package for Electra 11.3.1

Installs under `/usr/bin/`
